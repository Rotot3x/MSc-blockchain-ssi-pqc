"""Monkey patches for transparent PQC integration.

This module patches BaseConnectionManager and DIDExchangeManager to transparently
replace ED25519/X25519 with ML-DSA-65/ML-KEM-768 when creating did:peer:4 DIDs.

NO API changes needed - existing workflows continue to work!

    """Patched _qualified_did_with_fallback with PQC signature fix.

    CRITICAL FIX: For did:peer:4 with PQC, the `signing_key` parameter is often
    the `invitation_key` from the out-of-band invitation. However, this key is
    NOT the same as the authentication key in the did:peer:4 DID Document!

    For PQC did:peer:4:
    - The DID contains ML-DSA-65 authentication keys (1952 bytes)
    - The signature MUST use the authentication key from the DID
    - NOT the invitation_key (which might be a different key or from a different DID)

    This patch:
    1. Calls the original method
    2. If the DID is did:peer:4 and signing_key was provided, replaces it with
       the actual authentication key from the created DID
    3. Re-signs the attachment with the correct key

    This ensures DID Exchange signature verification succeeds!
